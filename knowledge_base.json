These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perceiving the environment. AI systems can range from rule-based systems to complex neural networks that can learn and adapt from experience.",

AI can include rule-based systems and other approaches that don't necessarily involve learning, while ML specifically deals with systems that improve their performance with experience and data.",

This is in contrast to traditional machine learning that requires large amounts of training data. The key idea is to leverage prior knowledge and adapt quickly to new tasks. This approach is particularly useful in real-world applications where collecting large datasets is expensive or impractical.",

The process involves embedding items into a vector space where similar items are closer together, enabling efficient similarity-based retrieval.",
